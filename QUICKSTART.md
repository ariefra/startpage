# Quickstart Guide ðŸš€

This guide will help you get your Startpage up and running quickly.

## 1. Download the Project

You can download the project by cloning the Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ariefra/startpage.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP archive from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ariefra/startpage/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## 2. Open `index.html`

Once you have the project files, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by dragging it into your browser window.

## 3. Set as Your Browser's Homepage (Optional)

To make this your default startpage, you can configure your browser's homepage settings:

*   **Chrome:** Go to `Settings > Appearance > New Tab page` and set it to `Open a specific page or set of pages` and add the path to your `index.html` file.
*   **Firefox:** Go to `Settings > Home > Homepage and new windows` and set it to `Custom URLs...` and add the path to your `index.html` file.
*   **Edge:** Go to `Settings > Start, home, and new tabs > Open these pages` and add the path to your `index.html` file.

## 4. Customization

You can customize your startpage by editing the `index.html` file. You can change:

*   **Background video:** Replace `background.mp4` with your own video file.
*   **Logo:** Replace `logo.png` with your own logo image.
*   **Search bar:** Modify the search form to use your preferred search engine.

Enjoy your new personalized startpage! âœ¨
