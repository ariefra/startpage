# Plan for Milestone 1.3: Implement customizable links (add, edit, delete).

## Objective
Create a section in `index.html` to display links. Develop JavaScript functions to dynamically add new links (with title and URL), edit existing ones, and remove them. Store link data in local storage as an array of objects.
