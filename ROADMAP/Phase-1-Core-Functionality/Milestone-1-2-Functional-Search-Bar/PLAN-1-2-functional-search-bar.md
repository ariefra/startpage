# Plan for Milestone 1.2: Functional search bar with configurable search engines.

## Objective
Implement an input field and a submit button in `index.html`. Use JavaScript to capture user input and redirect to the chosen search engine (e.g., Google, DuckDuckGo). Provide a mechanism (e.g., a dropdown or settings) to select the default search engine, storing this preference in local storage.
