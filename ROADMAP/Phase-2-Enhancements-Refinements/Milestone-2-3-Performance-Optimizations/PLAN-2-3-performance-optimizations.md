# Plan for Milestone 2.3: Performance optimizations (e.g., lazy loading, image optimization).

## Objective
Implement lazy loading for background images/videos. Optimize image assets (compression, appropriate formats). Minimize DOM manipulation and reflows. Consider using a build tool (e.g., Webpack, Parcel) for minification and bundling if the project grows.
