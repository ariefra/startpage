# Plan for Milestone 3.4: Integration with popular browser extensions/APIs.

Explore browser extension APIs (e.g., Chrome Extensions API, WebExtensions API) to allow deeper integration (e.g., setting as default new tab page, accessing browser history). This would likely involve creating a separate browser extension project.
