# Plan for Future Considerations: Testing.

## Objective
Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest for unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end tests). Write unit tests for core JavaScript functions (link management, local storage). Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows (adding a link, performing a search).
