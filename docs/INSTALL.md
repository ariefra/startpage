# Installation Guide ðŸ“¦

This document provides instructions on how to install and set up the Startpage project.

## 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the project repository from GitHub using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ariefra/startpage.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP archive directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ariefra/startpage/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it to your desired location.

## 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once cloned or extracted, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd startpage
```

## 3. Open `index.html`

This project is a static web application. To run it, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can do this by:

*   Double-clicking the `index.html` file in your file explorer.
*   Dragging and dropping the `index.html` file into an open browser window.
*   Using a local web server (e.g., Live Server VS Code extension, Python's `http.server`) to serve the directory, then navigating to `http://localhost:PORT` in your browser.

## 4. Set as Homepage (Optional)

If you wish to use this as your browser's default start page, you can configure your browser settings. Refer to the `QUICKSTART.md` file for detailed instructions on how to set it as your homepage in various browsers.

That's it! Your Startpage should now be up and running. ðŸŽ‰
