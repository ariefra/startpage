# Security Policy ðŸ”’

This document outlines the security policy for the Startpage project.

## 1. Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly and privately. **Do NOT open a public issue.** Instead, please contact [INSERT SECURITY CONTACT METHOD, e.g., a dedicated security email address or a private reporting channel].

We kindly request that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before any public disclosure.

## 2. Secure Development Practices

We strive to follow secure development practices, including:

*   **Input Validation:** All user inputs should be validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Least Privilege:** The application should operate with the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Dependency Management:** We aim to keep third-party dependencies updated to their latest secure versions. Regular checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies will be performed.
*   **No Sensitive Data Storage:** User preferences are stored in `localStorage`, which is not encrypted and should not be used for sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal identifiable information).
*   **HTTPS Only:** All network communications (if any) should occur over HTTPS to ensure data in transit is encrypted.

## 3. Data Privacy

This project primarily uses browser local storage for user preferences. No user data is collected, stored, or transmitted to external servers by default.

## 4. Future Enhancements

As the project evolves, we will consider implementing more advanced security measures, such as:

*   Content Security Policy (CSP).
*   Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines.
*   More robust authentication and authorization mechanisms if cloud synchronization is implemented.
